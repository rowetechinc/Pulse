            <br />   - In PredictionModel, fix bug in GetBurstDataStorage() when calculating number of burst per deployment.
            <br />   - In PredictionModel, fix bug in CalculatePowerBurst() when calculating number of burst per deployment.
            <br />   
            <br />   Pulse-Display-4.4.7
            <br />   - In ScreenDataViewModel, fixed RemovedShip to include instrument and ship transform.
